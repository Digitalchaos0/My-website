                Hi, I'm Carl! I’m a passionate gamer who loves playing games like Roblox, Minecraft, Mobile Legends, and Call of Duty. When I’m not gaming, I’m coding, mainly using Node.js, HTML, and Python to create cool projects. Aside from tech, I also enjoy staying active by playing badminton, which is one of my favorite real-life activities. I am proud to be a Filipino and my motherland, the Philippines, is where I call home.
